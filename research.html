	As a graduate student I studied how waves propagate 
	through microstructures, for example how light (the wave) 
	travels through a fiber optical cable (the microstructure). There 
	are two possible approaches to this problem: 
		<ol>
			<li>
				Given a microstructure, what are all possible forms of waves 
				that propagate through it? For example, many different 
				frequecies of light go through glass, but very little will 
				pass through a piece of wood. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Say you want to send a particular frequency of light, and only 
				that frequency, through a structure. The question then is 
				what type of material should it be made from? 
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	My work focused on the first problem. Figure 1 is a 
	sketch of the type of structures that we considered (most definitely 
	not to scale!). The different 
	shadings represent different materials, so you can think of the center 
	as a layering of sorts. The defining feature of this layered part is 
	that it is small in scale as compared to the remainder of the structure 
	and can be thought of as a manufacturing defect. 
	Another way of saying this is that when you zoom out 
	far enough, you no longer see these layers and (some would say that) neither does the wave 
	of light which is propagating though it. So on average, these layers 
	don't exits and the structure is made of just the one material.

	</figure>
	
	<p>
	That's the idea at least, but what we found is that this defect does 
	in fact have a significant conribution to the properties of the waves 
	that travel through this structure. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	To build up intuition, consider first a structure without the defect 
	and consider a laser beam shining on it as in the left side of Figure 2. The 
	beam widens and decreases in intensity as it travels through the 
	material. This is a similar effect to shinning a laser pointer 
	directly on your finger tip to make your finger light up. The 
	laser beam is no longer focused and spreads apart as it propagates 
	through your finger. 
	</p>

	</figure>	
	
	<p>
	In our research, we found that if we introduce a defect as in Figure 1, 
	a new part of the propagating wave emerges - a localized part. The 
	localized part does not change as it travels through the material 
	and, in theory at least, would propagate unchanged forever. 
	The right side of Figure 2 is a sketch of this behavior. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	These types of unchanging waves are important because they can be used to send
	signals across long distances. They are the types of waves of light that 
	travel through fiber optic cables. The materials that we worked with 
	weren't cables, but they're still important and can be used in various 
	small electrical components, such as cell phones or tablets.

	If you're interested in a more mathematical discussion of this work, 
	I recommend a series of blog posts on the topic written by Vincent: 
	<a href="https://vincentduchene.wordpress.com/2014/07/11/scattering-properties-of-highly-oscillatory-potentials-with-defects/" target="_blank">Part 1</a>,
