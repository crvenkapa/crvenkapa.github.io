	As a graduate student I analytically studied how waves propagate 
	through microstructures, for example how light (the wave) 
	travels through a fiber optical cable (the microstructure). There 
	are two possible approaches to this problem: 
		<ol>
			<li>
			Given a microstructure, what are all possible forms of waves 
			that propagate through it?
			</li>
			<li>
			Given that you wish to propagate a particular form of wave, 
			what type of microstructure would you need to design?
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	My work focused exclusively on the former problem. Figure 1 is a 
	sketch of the type of structures that we considered (most definitely 
	not to scale!). The different 
	shadings represent different materials, so you can think of the center 
	as a layering of sorts. The defining feature of this layered part is 
	that it is small in scale as compared to the remainder of the structure 
	and can be thought of as a manufacturing defect. 
	Another way of saying this is that when you zoom out 
	far enough, you no longer see these layers and (some would say that) neither does the wave 
	of light which is propagating though it. So on average, these layers 
	don't exits. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	That's the idea at least, but what we found is that this defect does 
	in fact have a significant conribution to the properties of the waves 
	that propagate through this structure.

	</figure>
	
	<p>
	To build up intuition, consider first a structure without the defect 
	and consider a laser beam shining on it as in the left side of Figure 2. The incident 
	beam widens and decreases in intensity as it travels through the 
	material. This is a similar effect to shinning a laser pointer 
	directly on your finger tip to make your finger light up. The 
	laser beam is no longer focused and spreads apart as it propagates 
	through your finger. 
	</p>

	</figure>	
	
	<p>
	In our research, we found that if we introduce a defect as in Figure 1, 
	a new part of the propagating wave emerges - a localized part. The 
	localized part does not change as it propagates through the material 
	and, in theory at least, would propagate unchanged forever. 
	The right side of Figure 2 is a sketch of this behavior. Waves of this 
	form are used to transport signals through waveguides such as optical 
	fibers.

	If you are interested in a more mathematical discussion of this work, 
	I recommend a series of blog posts on the topic written by Vincent:
