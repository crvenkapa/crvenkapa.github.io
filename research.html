		Here you will find the work that I did as a PhD student at
		<a href="http://apam.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>
		under the mentorship of
		<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~miw2103/" target="_blank">Michael I. Weinstein</a>. 
		Most of the work was also done in collaboration with

	As a graduate student I analytically studied how waves propagate 
	through microstructures, for example how light (the wave) 
	travels through a fiber optical cable (the microstructure). There 
	are two possible approaches to this problem: 
		<ol>
			<li>
			Given a microstructure, what are all possible forms of waves 
			that propagate through it?
			</li>
			<li>
			Given that you wish to propagate a particular form of wave, 
			what type of microstructure would you need to design?
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	My work focused exclusively on the former problem. Figure 1 is a 
	sketch of the type of structures that we considered. The different 
	shadings represent different materials. The defining feature of the 
	structures that we considered is the small scale layering of the 
	different materials in the center of the structure. The scale is 
	<q>small</q> in the sense that this part of the structure could be 
	thought of as a manufacturing defect with respect to the remainder 
	of the structure. On average, this section of the structure should 
	not contribute to any significant properties. However, we find that 
	this defect does in fact have a significant contribution. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	To build up intuition, consider first a structure without the defect 
	and consider a laser beam shining on it as in Figure 2. The incident 
	beam widens and decreases in intensity as it propagated through the 
	material. This is a similar effect to shinning a laser pointer 
	directly on your finger tip. What happens? Your finger lights up. The 
	laser pointer is no longer focused and spreads apart as it travels 
	through your finger. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In our research, we found that if we introduce a defect as in Figure 1, 
	a new part of the propagating wave emerges - a localized part. The 
	licalized part does not change as it propagates through the material 
	and, in theory at least, would propagate unchanged forever. Figure 3 
	is a sketch of this behavior. 
	</p>

	If you are interested in a more mathematical discussion of this work, 
	I recommend a series of blog posts on the topic written by Vincent:
